    <string name="title_second">Asana means \"stable body posture\" in Sanskrit. Such postures activate various systems of the body and saturate every cell with energy.\nIt is important not only to stay in a particular position, but also to breathe correctly. Then our heart, like a good motor, works more actively and our organs receive enough oxygen. Controlled breathing is what distinguishes yoga from gymnastics. By noticing each inhalation and exhalation, the practitioner can easily keep the focus on their sensations and maintain asana. At the same time yoga is not exhausting and does not make you literally drop dead after training.\nEveryone can \"adjust\" the practice to himself, even if the last time he did physical \neducation at school.\nTraining does not require\nextreme skills and pumped-up muscles,  but if you get on the mat regularly, there will be changes noticeable to the naked eye\n</string>
    <string name="practice_1_1">How many asanas are there in yoga?</string>
    <string name="practice_1_2"><![CDATA[There is a famous statement of Goraksha: \"There are as many asanas as there are species of different living beings. Shiva spoke of 8,400,000 asanas and he alone knew them. Out of this number, he selected 84 of which 4 are the most important and useful. These four - siddha, padma, simha and bhadra asanas are the best\"\nAsana consists of three stages: entering the pose, holding and exiting. It is important to stay in the asana for some time - from one minute. But the effect of practice will also be during dynamic work. For beginners at the first stages it is better to watch not the number and intensity of poses, but the correctness of their fulfilment.Â \nEach asana is a rejection of purely human nature and a repetition of the original divine movement, so it is important to hold the poses as accurately as possible. And if you have never practised before, for the first time it is better to go to a studio for group or individual lessons. The teacher will be able to create a unique set of asanas for you and will be able to tell you if you are doing something wrong\nAsanas help to keep everything in normal tonus - muscles, joints and organs. The postures have different effects:\n\n]]></string>
    <string name="practice_2_1">Yoga exercises: what benefits they bring to the body</string>
    <string name="practice_2_2">Standing asanas help to correct posture, find balance and develop joint and muscle elasticity. Standing yoga is a great foundation for more advanced practices in the future.\nSitting asanas can help you get rid of pain in your knees, ankles, hips or spine. Sitting yoga postures set you up for total relaxation and dialogue with yourself.\nInverted asanas allow you to forget about stress and disconnect from the problems of the outside world. These poses nourish the body with energy, give emotional balance and restore blood supply to the brain.\nInclines stretch the spine and the back of the hips, give a charge of vigour, relieve the feeling of heaviness in the back.\nBends help to eliminate slouching and tone the whole front part of the body - chest, abs, hips. They also improve digestion and open the chest, which improves oxygen circulation.\nTwists literally revitalise the spine, as they nourish the intervertebral discs. Such poses perfectly stimulate the work of internal organs.\nAsanas lying down help to restore the body after a hard day or illness. They are useful for women suffering from menstrual cramps, for asthmatics and people with digestive problems.\n\n</string>
    <string name="practice_3_1">How many seconds to hold a yoga pose?</string>
    <string name="practice_3_2">Asanas are stable positions, which means it is better to remain still and calm for some time, usually from 30 seconds to 5 minutes. It all depends on the level of training and the complexity of the asana itself, for example, in Shavasana you can stay up to 15 minutes. It is important not to forget about breathing, it helps to hold asanas. At first it may be difficult to keep the pose, to concentrate on sensations and to watch your breathing. But gradually the body will get used to the strain\n\n</string>
    <string name="practice_4_1">How does yoga end?</string>
    <string name="practice_4_2">Usually the complex ends with total relaxation - Shavasana, when students calm their breathing and let go of all worries. It is important not to cling to the flaring thoughts, but to let them flow quietly from one to another without getting stuck. Relaxing asanas are very important because they teach you to listen to your sensations and desires. Shavasana perfectly consolidates the result of practice, helps the body to internalise the experience, and the mind to switch from physical activity to complete relaxation.\n\n</string>
    <string name="practice_5_1">What is static in yoga?</string>
    <string name="practice_5_2">Static is based on holding an asana for a long time. Whereas vinyasa flow requires dynamic movement from one pose to another, here practitioners try to hold their postures for a long time. Static teaches us to hear and listen to our body at a deep level: by staying in a pose, we study it from the inside, find new vectors of work, understand the form literally centimetre by centimetre. And at the same time we strengthen muscles. Practically any asana can be performed in static mode - from Tadasana to Shirshasana. Virabhadrasana I and II, Uttthita Trikonasana, Vrikshasana are excellent starting yoga poses where you can learn to breathe deeply and explore the possibilities of the body in static mode.</string>

In order not to have a bend in the lower back, pull the belly up slightly, pointing the navel towards the spine.\nBring the shoulders back in a circular motion and lower them down. The chin is also slightly lowered down to stretch and relax the back of the neck. Take 5-10 deep inhalations and exhalations here, filling the abdomen and ribs with air. With the next exhalation, turn to the right - place the right hand behind the back, but do not transfer the body weight to it. With the left palm hug the knee or thigh of the right leg. Keep your back straight and continue to stretch your head towards the ceiling. Stay here for 3-5 cycles of deep breathing.

Imagine the whole body coming together in the centre - it is strong and immovable. Linger in this position for a few breath cycles. Now we move to the dynamics: on the inhalation we perform a bend, directing the top of the head and tailbone to the ceiling, with the exhalation we round the upper back and push the shoulder blades apart from the spine. Perform this movement 7-10 times - gently, feeling how the spine is being developed.\nSimplifications. If the wrists are weak, perform the form on the forearms.\nBenefits.
